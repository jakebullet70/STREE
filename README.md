# stree
XTree inspired file manager for the Commander X16

Shelfing this. The compiler has some issues are are producing PRG's that are corrupting and ust plain blowing chunks. If you want to reproduce do a search for 'BOOM' and un-rem the lines.  

Anyway, hope to revist some day but now moving STREE to Prog8
